### CIS6397 Assignment2: Due on Oct 5 11:59 PM

The objective of this assignment is to identify the student, GitHub class identifier, and GitHub account name. You need to produce a table with consistent information by extracting and cleaning data from multiple files. Four raw data files are provided in the data folder:
-  github-login.xlsx: This file has been used to collect github login email information from the class. Because it was downloaded from the blackboard before enrollment is closed, some people on the name list have dropped the class and some people who registered later are not on this list. For people enrolled in the class but not on this list, they manually added their information to the table.
-  github-login Copy.xlsx: This file is generated by someone making a copy of the github-login.xlsx. Because of this, some people input their github information into this file while some people provide inputs into both "github-login.xlsx" and "github-login Copy.xlsx".
-  enroll-list.csv: This is the up-to-date enrollment list of this class. It contains two columns, "Last Name" and "First Name".
-  github-roster.csv: This is the GitHub records on identifiers and corresponding GitHub usernames. The identifier is the GitHub login email provided by people in this class. Because some people did not link correct identifier to their GitHub account when accepting the assignment, there is some missing information.

Your task in this assignment is to:
1. Merge "github-login.xlsx" and "github-login Copy.xlsx". Produce a new file called "github-email.csv". The file has three columns: "Last Name", "First Name", and "GitHub email". You should remove all duplicated rows and rows without email inputs. You should keep the row having email but no names. For rows that provide multiple emails, only keep the first one. The output should be sorted by "Last Name". 
2. Use "enroll-list.csv" as the reference, and correct the "Last Name" and "First Name" columns in the "github-email.csv". Produce a new file called "enroll-github-email.csv". The file has three columns: "Last Name", "First Name", and "GitHub email". The "Last Name" and "First Name" columns should be the same as the "enroll-list.csv". Find the corresponding GitHub login email for each people in the list. The output should be sorted by "Last Name".
3. Use the "github-roster.csv" to extract the matching GitHub username and github email (roster_identifier) pair. Use matching pairs and "enroll-github-email.csv" to produce a new file called "assignment1-github-roster.csv". The file has four columns: "Last Name", "First Name", "GitHub_username", and "GitHub_email".  

Some additional requirements for this assignment:
1. You can use at most one for-loop block in this assignment.
2. You can have at most two hard "value assignment" statements, which means you can only manually fix two records. The rest inconsistencies among raw data files should be solved by your code using e.g. Python string matching, or other Python utilities.
